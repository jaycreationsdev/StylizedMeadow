The Stylized Meadow Environment is a highly optimized and performant asset that allows you to create beautiful stylized environments. This asset is made to work with my 100 Stylized Trees package, although there are 20 different trees (with different textures) provided within this pack. (Note that the tree materials in this pack are not as complex as the ones within the package mentioned) With this asset, you get the following:




    5 Fence/Cart Props
    21 Plants such as flowers, grass, bushes, etc.
    6 Stylized Rocks
    20 Stylized Trees



With many different types of plants, a beautiful landscape and grass material, and a few props, you can make a wide variety of environments. There are a lot of amazing things you can do with the materials within this package, so I will be creating a full documentation soon.

Technical Details

Features:


     Highly complex grass material that has many unique parameters to play around with.
     Customize anything easily, everything uses material instances to allow for full control over color, wind, roughness, pixel depth offset, etc.
     Uses pixel depth offset to give a soft look on the edges of some meshes.
     The Landscape material and the Grass material both use a mask to pan color through them, meaning there is a seamless transition between the grass and the landscape.
    Many of the assets have variations that you can use to give you as many options as possible.
    Automatic Grass Generation that places grass, flowers, and bushes of all types on the landscape.
    Performance is excellent. Shader complexity is considered high on older versions of UE4, but 4.24+ should be all green.
